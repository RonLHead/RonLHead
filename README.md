### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Ron L Head and I am a recent gradute from the Turing School of Software and Design!

As a front-end developer, I blend award-winning customer and technical service, useful aesthetics, and investigative analysis to solve user problems before they occur.

Iâ€™ve pivoted my drive for excellence from 11 years in customer and technical support roles to software development. I saw the need for responsive applications that improve the user experience. I bring with me customer-centered issue resolution, empathetic communication, a team-player disposition, and the ability to multitask in a quick paced, metrics oriented environment.

I approach projects systematically with strong TDD, clean and professional UX design, and thoughtful SRP. Colleagues seek me out for code reviews and debugging assistance because of my logic and friendly disposition. Committed to inclusivity, I write code with accessibility and coder empathy in mind.
